Cook made dogged 147 off 286 balls in his final knock while skipper Root roared back to form with a stylish 125, his first hundred in 28 innings, as the duo grinded the Indian bowling into submission with 259-run stand.</p>\r\n<p>Courtesy the twin hundreds by the former and current skipper, England declared their second innings on 423/8 with a massive target of 464 for the Indians. Deflated after fielding for over 112 overs, India\'s wobbly top-order once again faltered with Shikhar Dhawan (1), Cheteshwar Pujara (0) and Virat Kohli (0) dismissed in quick succession with day end score being 58 for 3 With 406 runs required on the final day and seven wickets in hand, an embarrassing 1-4 series defeat looks imminent for India as of now. The wily Jimmy Anderson (2/23) equalled Glenn McGrath\'s 563 Test wickets and is expected to break the record on Tuesday while Stuart Broad (1/17) with 433 wickets is just one short of Kapil Dev\'s (434 wickets). Dhawan\'s poor technique was once again exposed as he was adjudged plumb leg before to an incoming delivery from Anderson.</p>\r\n<p>Ditto for Pujara, who got a sharp incutter that breached his defence. He wanted a DRS but was late in appealing for one. Skipper Virat Kohli after a tremendous English summer where he scored 593 runs finally got out for a duck as he nicked one off Broad to Jonny Bairstow, leaving India in tatters. KL Rahul (46 batting) batted in cavalier fashion hitting eight boundaries in the company of Ajinkya Rahane (10 batting). However, the day certainly belonged to Cook, who scored his 33rd hundred his last appearance to join a select band of players having scored a hundred on debut and final Test. He is fifth in the list after Reginal Duff, Bill Ponsford, Greg Chappell and Mohammed Azharuddin. His 286-ball knock had 14 boundaries and it certainly overshadowed Cook\'s 190 ball effort that had 12 fours and a six.</p>\r\n<p>Their partnership literally killed the contest after Ishant Sharma\'s ankle injury had pegged India further back. In the post-lunch session, the duo looked to build on their partnership and further frustrate the Indian bowlers, bringing up their 200-stand off 303 balls. Root, on 94, got a second life as Cheteshwar Pujara dropped him at first slip off Mohammed Shami (2-97) in the 77th over. He then went on to score his 14th Test hundred off 151 balls. Thereafter, Root started attacking as England crossed 300 in the 88th over. India were a bowler short with Ishant leaving the field due to ankle pain. Hanuma Vihari (3/37) struck twice in the 95th over. First, Root holed out and then Cook was caught behind, with the opener walking off to a standing ovation as well as congratulatory handshakes from the Indian team. Shami then got the reward as Jonny Bairstow (18) played on and Ravindra Jadeja (2-147) removed Jos Buttler for a duck as England looked to score some quick runs in sight of a declaration. Earlier, Cook\'s hundred helped England reach 243-2 at lunch. Starting from overnight 114-2, first up he reached his half-century off 127 balls. He and Root continued to plunder runs at an easy pace as 55 runs came in the first hour of play, and 129 runs overall in this morning session, the best of this fifth Test.</p>\r\n<p>In doing so, the duo raised their 100-partnership off 171 balls as Cook started breaking records. First, on 76, he went past Kumar Sangakkara as the highest-scoring left-handed batsman in Test cricket history and will finish as the fifth-highest run-scorer overall after Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid. Meanwhile, at the other end, Root scored his half-century off 81 balls as England crossed 200 in the 63rd over. He had been dropped at slip by Ajinkya Rahane, on 46, off Jadeja in the 56th over. The big moment then came in the 70th over of this innings as an overthrow from Jasprit Bumrah (0-61) gave Cook his 33rd Test century off 210 balls, surpassing Australia\'s Steve Waugh (32). Additionally, Cook became only the fifth batsman in Test cricket history to score hundreds in his first and last matches, after Australians Reggie Duff, Bill Ponsford, Greg Chappell and India\'s Mohammad Azharuddin.</p>\r\n<p>Further, this was his seventh Test hundred against India, more than any other English batsman, ahead of Kevin Pietersen\'s six hundreds. He is now also the second-highest run-scorer in Test cricket after Ponting (2555 runs). With 15 hundreds in second innings in Test cricket, he also overtook Sangakkara (14 hundreds). India seemed to have gone off the boil especially with one strike bowler short, as the duo ground them for runs.</p>', '0', 1, 'published', 1),

The Income Tax Department in March this year had served a notice to the Gandhis saying that their tax filings will be reviewed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Congress leaders had challenged the notice in the court. The judges also dismissed the petition of Congress leader Oscar Fernandes who too had challenged the reopening of his tax assessment for the same year. Earlier this year in May, the Delhi High Court had refused to stop an income tax investigation into Young Indian, a company which has Sonia and Rahul Gandhi as its main stakeholders, asking it to first approach tax authorities. At the heart of the case was Associated Journals Limited, publisher of three newspapers, including the National Herald, an English daily founded and edited by Jawaharlal Nehru before he became India\'s first prime minister.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2008, the company shut down with an alleged unpaid debt of about 90 crore rupees. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has accused Rahul Gandhi, PM Nehru\'s great-grandson, and Sonia, of setting up Young Indian Company to buy the debt using Congress party funds even though Associated Journals allegedly had real estate assets worth at least 2,000 crores, which would have cleared the debt. Mr Swamy alleged that the Young Indian Company then owned all of the equity in Associated Journals and rented out its properties to profit its shareholders, including Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, who together controlled 76 per cent.</p>', '0', 1, 'published', 1),

If confirmed, it would be the second heist from the chic hotel on Paris\'s Place Vendome this year.</p>\r\n<p>In January, axe-bearing thieves burst into the lobby and stole millions of dollars worth of necklaces and other jewellery from display cases. Police managed to catch three of them inside, and two others who escaped on a scooter ended up dropping a bag of their loot. All the jewels were eventually recovered. Armed thefts are not uncommon in the area, where dozens of luxury boutiques and jewellery stores align the streets. In December 2017, a man was able to substitute two diamonds and two rings worth 5.5 million euros in a jewellery store, replacing them with cheap fakes.

The aircraft is being manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and some dry runs were conducted earlier. The milestone was achieved at 9.30 am when 1,900 kg of fuel was transferred from the mid-air refuelling tanker of IAF\'s IL78 to the <strong>Tejas LSP8</strong> at an altitude of 20,000 feet, HAL said in a release.</p>\r\n<p>The refueling increases the fighter jets endurance and adds a lethal punch. Apart from this, it also increases its range. The feat was achieved days after the Indian Air Force (<strong>IAF</strong>) successfully did a dry run of mid-air refuelling using the Russian-built IL-78 MKI tanker. The IAF IL78 was piloted by Wing Commander Siddharth Singh with designers from HAL and Aeronautical Development Agency monitoring the system parameteres from the Gwalior ground station. According to HAL, the speed of Tejas was 270 knots when all the internal tanks and drop tanks were refuelled.</p>\r\n<p>The Indian Air Force currently operates nine Tejas fighters built to an Initial Operating Clearance standard. These jets are being flown by No. 45 Squadron, the Flying Daggers, based at Sulur Air Force Station in Tamil Nadu. There are still a handful of development strides that the Tejas needs to achieve to be the multi-role jet the Indian Air Force seeks. Though Israeli built Derby air-to-air missiles have been successfully integrated onto the Tejas, the jet still needs to integrate a Russian built <strong>GSh-23</strong> gun besides expanding its flight envelope.</p>', '0', 1, 'published', 1),

Doctors attending the former Bihar CM at RIMS have mentioned this in their report, Mr Shrivastava told PTI, adding that depression was also mentioned in the medical discharge slip from AIIMS. Asked about reports that a psychiatrist may look into Lalu Yadav\'s condition, Mr Shrivastava said there is no update as of now. Some media reports have attributed Lalu Yadav\'s deteriorating health to corruption cases affecting his family and also reports of political one-upmanship between his two sons. Lalu Yadav has already publicly shown his preference for younger son Tejashwi Yadav as his heir apparent. But elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, a senior minister in the previous grand alliance, has high public standing.</p>\r\n<p>Tej Pratap\'s padyatra (foot march) from Patna to Sitab Diara, the birthplace of socialist leader Jai Prakash Narayan, is seen as counter to Tejashwi\'s July bicycle yatra from Bodh Gaya to Patna. On Wednesday last, Lalu Yadav was shifted to the paying ward of the hospital after RIMS accepted his prayer that cited poor hygiene, mosquito menace and bark of dogs as perilous to his health. Lalu Yadav, convicted in the fodder scam, was shifted to the 100-bed paying ward, Mr Shrivastava had said. The RJD supremo will have to pay Rs. 1,000 per day at the present ward. Mr Shrivastava said the change was done after permission was obtained from the jail superintendent. After spending a few months out of jail, the RJD supremo surrendered before a <strong>CBI court</strong> in Ranchi on August 30, upon the expiry of the provisional bail granted to him by the Jharkhand High Court for medical treatment.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

By doing so, the army would save between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 7,000 crore which could be used to bump up its capital expenditure account used to maintain and replenish the stock of weaponry that it currently holds. At the moment, 83 per cent or Rs. 1.28 lakh crore of the army\'s total budget goes towards its revenue expenses - day-to-day running costs and salaries.</p>\r\n<p>This does not include the army\'s annual pension pay out which is independently accounted for. Just 17 per cent of the budget, Rs. 26,826 crore, goes towards capital expenditure - a figure the army finds wholly unsatisfactory. By shedding flab over the next few years and adding up to Rs. 7,000 crore, the army may be able to raise its capital budget to between Rs. 31,826 and Rs. 33,826 crore. In March, the then Vice Chief of the Army, Lt General Sarath Chand told a parliamentary panel, <em>\"The state today is [that] 68 per cent of our equipment is in the vintage category with just about 24 per cent in the current and 8 per cent in the state-of-the-art category.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>What\'s more, the modernisation budget of the army, used to procure new systems essential in increasing firepower is woefully inadequate. \"Allocation of Rs. 21,338 crore for modernisation is insufficient even to cater for committed payment of Rs. 29,033 crore for 125 on-going schemes and emergency procurements,\" said Lt General Chand in his deposition to the parliamentary panel. Sources in the army have clarified that the proposal being looked at to reduce manpower is still to be accepted and that there is no question of laying off serving officers and soldiers. 60,000 personnel retire from the army every year.</p>\r\n<p>If the army were to reduce it manpower, it would do so by cutting down on its annual recruitment spread over a few years. At the moment, four senior Lieutenant Generals of the Army are preparing reports looking into how the Indian Army, the fourth largest in the world, can be made into a more efficient force. The reports look at army headquarters restructuring, restructuring of the Indian Army, an officer cadre review and a report looking into the terms and conditions of service of Junior Commissioned Officers (<strong>JCOs</strong>), soldiers who have a lower status that officers who are fully commissioned.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

Taking a dig at PM Modi, Mr Gandhi said the prime minister\'s claim that what happened in the last four years of his rule has not happened in 70 years is actually true. \"Hatred is being spread, one Indian is fighting the other, the country is being divided,\" he said. \"<em>Diesel, petrol price rise is out of our hands because oil producing countries have limited production...

Twenty-two opposition parties are participating in the Bharat Bandh -- the exception being Arvind Kejriwal\'s Aam Aadmi Party and Mamata Banerjee\'s Trinamool Congress. Top opposition leaders like Sharad Pawar, MK Stalin and Left leaders have supported the strike, the effect of which was especially evident in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Bihar. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu announced a cut in state tax for fuel today, which will bring the prices down by <strong>Rs. 2.</strong> A similar cut was announced yesterday by the BJP government in Rajasthan, where elections will be held later this year.</p>\r\n<p>Violence was reported from some states. In parts of Gujarat\'s Bharuch, protesters burnt tyres and forced shops to close. In Bihar capital Patna, Jan Adhikar Party workers vandalised vehicles. In Maharashtra\'s Pune, the police arrested six workers of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena who were trying to close shops forcibly. The Congress said it has urged party workers not to indulge in any violent protest. Hitting out at the opposition parties, Mr Prasad said they should stop this \"dance of violence and game of death\". Citing the death of a three-year old girl in Bihar who died before getting medical attention because of the ambulance being delayed, the minister asked if Congress president Rahul Gandhi will take responsibility for it. Schools and colleges remained closed in Bengaluru as Karnataka\'s ruling Janata Dal Secular, which is in alliance with the Congress, said it would support the day-long protest. Schools in Odisha too are closed, though Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik\'s party refused to back the shutdown.</p>\r\n<p>Train and road traffic were affected in many parts of Bihar. Over a dozen long distance trains had to be stopped at Patna, Gaya, Bhojpur, Jehanabad, Bhagalpur and Muzaffarpur railway stations. The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal expressed support on the issues on which the shutdown has been called, but said it was against any kind of strike in the state according to the stated policy of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.

Rumours largely suggest that three iPhone models are coming this year - an iPhone X successor with a 5.8-inch OLED model, possibly named the <em>iPhone Xs</em>; a larger 6.5-inch OLED model, the <em>iPhone Xs Plus</em>; and a cheaper 6.1-inch LCD model that could be named the <em>iPhone Xc</em>. A new leak has now surfaced online that reveals the expected pricing of the three iPhone variants. At a China Mobile meeting in the telecom operator\'s home country, first spotted on Weibo, the pricing of the purported iPhone 2018 models has been leaked.</p>\r\n<p>According to a slide, the cheapest iPhone Xc will get a starting price tag of CNY 5,888 (roughly Rs. 62,100), the iPhone Xs will be priced starting at CNY 7,388 (approximately Rs. 77,900), and the iPhone Xs Plus might start at CNY 8,388 (about Rs. 88,400). This seems slightly inflated when we consider previous reports that suggested lower pricing for all three variants. Apart from that, a CNBC report also claims an analyst from Goldman Sachs says that the cheapest iPhone, called the iPhone 9 in this report, will actually come at a base price of $849 (roughly Rs. 61,500) instead of the previously rumoured $699 (around Rs. 50,600).</p>\r\n<p>As per this forecast, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> raised its price target for Apple\'s stock to $240 (approximately Rs. 17,400) from $200 (about Rs. 14,500) and remained positive for the short term. <em>Dual-SIM</em> slots are expected on the iPhone Xc, though even the dual-SIM model is said to be limited to China only. It is also unclear whether the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Plus will also get the dual-SIM treatment or not. Also, whatever pricing Apple decides to set for the upcoming iPhone models will be announced in the next couple of days at the event slated for 10am PT (10:30pm IST) on September 12.

There is a reason why breakfast is hailed as the most important meal of the day. It is the first meal of the day which gives a kickstart to your energy levels. On days when you skip breakfast, your metabolism messes up. Skipping up breakfast slows down body\'s fat burning process. Also, on days when you skip breakfast, you are more likely to make poor food habits throughout the day.

In his report to the panel headed by BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, Raghuram Rajan says overoptimistic bankers, government foot-dragging and slow growth were factors in mounting bad loans. He also said the size of frauds in the public sector banking system had been increasing, though was still small compared to the overall volume of NPAs or Non-Performing Assets.</p>\r\n<p>\"<em>The RBI set up a fraud monitoring cell when I was Governor to coordinate the early reporting of fraud cases to the investigative agencies. I also sent a list of high profile cases to the PMO urging that we coordinate action to bring in at least one or two to book. I am not aware of progress on this front. This is a matter that should be addressed with urgency,</em>\" said Mr Rajan in his report. Unfortunately, he said, the system had been \"singularly ineffective\" in bringing even a single high profile fraudster to book. \"<em>As a result, fraud is not discouraged</em>,\" Mr Rajan said. Though he does not specify the year, the Congress seized on the point and alleged that the former Reserve Bank of India governor had indicted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his office. \"<em>Why didn\'t the PM take action against these known defaulters? When we demitted office the NPA was 2.83 lakh crore. How much is bad loans today- it\'s Rs. 12 lakh crore,</em>\" said Congress leader Randeep Surjewala.</p>\r\n<p>Union Minister Smriti Irani of the BJP, however, called the report a \"<em>loud proclamation</em>\" of corruption on Congress watch. \"<em>Raghuram Rajan had said between 2006 and 2011, the UPA functioning led to increase in NPA (Non-Performing Assets) in banking structure,</em>\" she said. \"The UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi led a government that attacked the very core of the Indian banking system,\" alleged Smriti Irani. A larger number of bad loans originated in the period 2006-2008, said Mr Rajan\'s report, when economic growth was strong and previous infrastructure projects such as power plants had been completed on time and within budget. \"<em>It is at such times that banks make mistakes. They extrapolate past growth and performance to the future. So, they are willing to accept higher leverage in projects, and less promoter equity. Indeed, sometimes banks signed up to lend based on project reports by the promoter\'s investment bank, without doing their own due diligence,</em>\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>This is the historic phenomenon of irrational exuberance, common across countries at such a phase in the cycle, said Mr Rajan, who was RBI governor for three years till September 2016. His report also said: \"<em>A variety of governance problems such as the suspect allocation of coal mines coupled with the fear of investigation slowed down government decision-making in Delhi, both in the UPA and the subsequent NDA governments</em>\". Project cost overruns escalated for stalled projects and they became increasingly unable to service debt, he said. \"<em>The continuing travails of the stranded power plants, even though India is short of power, suggests government decision-making has not picked up sufficient pace to date,\"</em> he assessed. On malfeasance and corruption in the NPA problem, he said, \"<em>Undoubtedly, there was some, but it is hard to tell banker exuberance, incompetence, and corruption apart</em>\". \"<em>Clearly, bankers were overconfident and probably did too little due diligence for some of these loans. Many did no independent analysis, and placed excessive reliance on SBI Caps and IDBI to do the necessary due diligence,</em>\" the note said. He also tackled criticism of his policy to identify NPAs, saying the claim was \"<em>ludicrous</em>\" and made by people who have not done their homework. Stating that \"hindsight is 20/20\", Mr Rajan said the RBI \"<em>should probably have raised more flags about the quality of lending in the early days of banking exuberance</em>.\" He added: \"<em>The RBI could have been more decisive in enforcing penalties on non-compliant banks. Fortunately, this culture of leniency has been changing in recent years.</em>\" Mr Rajan was invited to brief the parliamentary committee after former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian praised him before the group, headed by veteran BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, for identifying the NPA crisis and trying to resolve it.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

The grand old party, Farooq Abdullah\'s National Conference, was the first to say it would boycott local bodies and panchayat elections. Then Mehbooba Mufti\'s <strong>PDP</strong>, the other big regional player, followed suit. Various smaller parties have already said no to the elections, scheduled for October-December.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The parties say they cannot support the election process at a time when the centre is not supporting <strong>Article 35A</strong> - the cornerstone of Kashmir\'s special constitutional status in the Indian Union. The Article, passed through a Presidential order in 1954, has been challenged in the Supreme Court, which has deferred hearing the matter to January upon the centre\'s request. The centre said the hearing and verdict could impact the holding of panchayat and municipal elections. The regional parties hit back, saying, \"We will not participate before the issue is resolved and safeguarding of Article 35A is assured. Getting people to vote has been both a challenge and advantage for India in Kashmir. Separatist groups demand a vote for plebiscite. They say India\'s commitment to the UN and the people of Kashmir on holding a referendum makes this obligatory. Till then, they want a boycott of all elections which they believe strengthens Indian democracy in the state. Militants enforce this boycott by targeting anyone who stands against this idea. Unionist parties have been fighting this idea by supporting the cause of elections. Today, both sides have found a common cause, which has led to a sense of vindication for separatists.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The controversy surrounding Article 35A has blurred the lines. A year ago, I had written about how the challenge to Article 35A could push mainstream parties to the wall and the dangerous consequences of that. Minus mainstream politics, the military remains India\'s only identity in Kashmir. Both Delhi and Srinagar have to turn the fears and controversy over Article 35 A into an opportunity to strengthen the idea of the mainstream. Any mishandling can have far-reaching consequences. Farooq Abdullah has already threatened to further boycott state and national elections if concerns over Article 35A are not addressed. Delhi\'s outreach could make all the difference and create a starting point for a dialogue between the national capital and Srinagar through mainstream parties. National Conference (<strong>NC</strong>) is the party which has shaped the politics of the state, from ratifying J&amp;K\'s instrument of accession with the Union of India to its plebiscite movement after the party patriarch and then Prime Minister of J&amp;K state, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was jailed in August 1953. Following the Indira-Abdullah accord, Sheikh returned to the mainstream in 1975 which led to the first participative, free and fair election in the state in 1977.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the emergence of militancy, the NC became the main target in the attempt to wipe out pro-India politics in Kashmir. Hundreds of party workers were killed by militants for its stand supporting the Indian democratic system. After living in exile, Farooq Abdullah returned to contest elections in 1996 following assurances of the restoration of the state\'s autonomy. From Burkina Faso, then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao promised, \"The sky is the limit\" for Kashmir\'s autonomy, \"short of Azadi.\" Subsequently, the United Front Government included greater autonomy to J&amp;K in its common minimum programme. But when Farooq Abdullah came up with a resolution on autonomy that was passed by the J&amp;K assembly in 2000, the central government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee summarily rejected it, partly because of Abdullah\'s own non-seriousness. Instead of submitting a copy of the autonomy report and assembly resolution to the Prime Minister himself, he chose to hand it over to an intelligence officer in Srinagar for further perusal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 2002 assembly elections saw the emergence of PDP which led to competitive politics laced with sub-nationalistic rhetoric. Vajpayee reached out to the people of Kashmir, giving much needed credence to mainstream politics. The gun lost its coercive power. The era of coercive voting and coercive boycotts was over. Mainstream politics became participative. The mainstream politics took roots and withstood 2008 and 2010 civilian unrest. Boycott calls by separatists were rejected with massive participation in elections. It was during and after 2016 that things went horribly wrong. The centre\'s muscular policy coupled with the state government\'s arrogance and incompetence compounded the problem. The state resorted to collective punishment of people. Areas showing dissent were treated like enemy territories. Damaging electric transformers to cut power supply to villages, vandalising houses and orchards were some of the means employed to punish the rebellious population.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Victims were blamed for their death, injuries and mass blinding. People exacted revenge through voting. In April 2017, the by-election for Srinagar witnessed a humiliating 7% turnout. The Anantnag by-election had to be cancelled a day before the voting. Since then, the debate has surged over whether elections can be held in Kashmir in the near future. Mind you, it is not militancy that\'s posing a challenge, nor is the problem something that can be dealt with by using more force. The challenge is coming from the people. They are angry, hurt and frustrated. With Governor\'s Rule in place, the announcement to hold municipal and panchayat elections without any consultation with political parties was bound to boomerang. The time to initiate talks and find a solution is now. The centre must act.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

But, all that is about to change as the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (<strong>FSSAI</strong>) has started a massive initiative to raise the quality of street food vending to the level of food courts and established hotels and restaurants. The government organisation has even declared a popular street food area in <strong>Ahmedabad, Gujarat</strong>, as India\'s first \'<strong>Clean Street Food Hub\'</strong>. An FSSAI press release on the announcement said that Kankaria Lake, with about 66 street food vendors, has won the tag of India\'s first \'Clean Street Food Hub.\' With cuisines like pao bhaji, Chinese, bhel puri, ice cream, khichu, popcorn, dhokla, masala dosa, pani puri etc., and the release said that the area caters to about 1.2 crore street food enthusiasts every year.</p>\r\n<p>FSSAI has even installed a plaque at the location, which means that Gujarati foodies in the state\'s capital can now happily flock to any of the numerous stalls in Kankaria Lake and partake in the delicious food, without any worries of tummy troubles or diseases. Concerned authorities have declared that \"the street of Kankaria Lake, Ahmedabad meets 80% of the specified benchmarks of basic hygiene and sanitary requirements, and hence, can be awarded as \'Clean Street Food Hub\',\" says the press release. This declaration was only made after the area was first identified as a popular food street and a pre-audit of the stalls here was conducted by FSSAI along with FDCA, Gujarat and DNVGL Business Assurance India Pvt. Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>The officials gave suggestions to fill in gaps in the hygiene standards of the vendors here and consequently Food Safety Awareness and Training Organisation (<strong>FSATO</strong>) was delegated the work of training the street food vendors, with special attention to areas improvement was required. As a part of the initiative, FSSAI has also framed guidelines to improve the existing infrastructure of famous street food areas and clusters in cities and towns across India, in order to provide tourists and foodies with a safe and hygienic local eating experience.</p>\r\n<p>The release on the announcement quoted Pawan Kumar, the CEO of FSSAI as saying, \"We all Indians are fond of street food, and yet not very comfortable taking it for reason of poor hygiene and quality.\" He added by saying that the Clean Street Food Hub initiative was aimed at radically improving street food vending in the country to make Indian street food, \"popular and \'must have\' for both domestic and international tourists while also preserving rich culinary heritage of the country.\" Next on FSSAI\'s list of are four more Gujarat cities - Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Dahod - which will be converted to Clean Street Food Hubs in the coming months.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

While leaks are flowing in at a steady pace, a fresh piece of information reveals a key feature of the smartphone, with the source being OnePlus itself. The company has now confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will sport an in-display fingerprint scanner, and OnePlus is going to call the feature Screen Unlock. This new feature suggests that there will be no inconvenient rear fingerprint sensor, and the Screen Unlock and the Face Unlock features will be the new security options on the OnePlus 6T. OnePlus confirmed to <strong>CNET</strong> that the OnePlus 6T will sport an in-display fingerprint sensor. It even shared a screenshot of how the sensor will look like on the lockscreen of the OnePlus 6T, and you can see it below. \"We unlock our phones multiple times a day, and Screen Unlock reduces the number of steps to complete the action.</p>\r\n<p>By adding this feature as an addition to other display unlocking options such as Face Unlock, users will have options to unlock the display in a way that is most efficient for them,\" OnePlus told the publication in an email. There\'s also a mention of October 17, which may just be the date of the launch. We\'ve reached out to the company for confirmation. As mentioned, OnePlus is calling it Screen Unlock, and it joins the few smartphones in the market with an in-display fingerprint sensor. This list currently includes the Vivo V11, Vivo X20 Plus UD, Vivo X21, Vivo Nex, and the Huawei Porsche Design Mate RS. CNET had earlier also reported that the OnePlus 6T will be the first OnePlus device to be listed with a major US carrier network T-Mobile this year, as the company looks to expand its footprint in the US market. The OnePlus 6T is expected to launch sometime in early October with a price tag of $550 (roughly Rs. 39,500).</p>\r\n<p>A recent image leak suggested a waterdrop notch, thin bezel, and a triple camera setup at the back. The triple camera setup on the OnePlus 6T is likely to be accompanied by an LED flash. Historically, the company has followed the trend of launching new succeeding models with a \'T\' after the name of their original versions. These \'T\' variants have minimal upgrades, with seldom ever any change with respect to design. However, with the OnePlus 6T, the company is looking to make several design changes, and we hope to see more information from official channels soon.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

Jaanni thi na \'khush khabri\'?</em>,\" Ayushmann tweeted on Tuesday as he shared the trailer. The surprise element is right at the beginning of the trailer, when Ayushmann\'s onscreen mother, played by none other than Neena Gupta, is declared pregnant. It appears that Ayushmann\'s father, played by Gajraj Rao, is quite a colourful character and romantic at heart, who is mercilessly trolled by his mother as he breaks the baby news to the family. The only one who is absolutely chill with the baby announcement appears to be Sanya Malhotra, who plays Ayushmann\'s girlfriend in the movie.</p>\r\n<p>The trailer is filled with hilarious one-liners and how Ayushmann and family deal with \"<em><strong>mummy papa ka mishap</strong></em>\" and subsequently \"<em><strong>society ka crap</strong></em>\". Neena Gupta, who plays a middle-aged housewife, delivers just a few dialogues in the trailer but speaks a thousand words with her brilliant expressions - mostly those of anger redirected towards her loving husband. Meanwhile, Ayushmann is tired of dodging congratulatory messages from friends and neighbours. The trailer last offers glimpses of celebrated actors like Surekha Sikri (Ayushmann\'s grandmother in the movie) and Sheeba Chaddha (who plays Sanya\'s onscreen mother). From the trailer, Badhaai Ho appears to be a must watch family comedy.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

The 39-year-old bank executive is suspected to have been killed in a robbery, the police say. Sarfaraz Shaikh, a 20-year-old driver, who was arrested on Sunday, allegedly killed the executive because he needed money, Deputy Commissioner of Police Abhinash Kumar said.</p>\r\n<p>He was detained in Navi Mumbai and handed over to <strong>Mumbai Police</strong>, which placed him under arrest, the police said. According to Mr Kumar, Sarfaraz had bought a motorcycle and needed about Rs. 35,000 to pay off a loan. On Wednesday night, he cornered the 39-year-old bank executive after work in the parking lot of his office and demanded money. When the banking executive raised an alarm, Sarfaraz stabbed him. Panicking, he took the body to neighbouring Thane and after dumping it, he took the banker\'s car to Koparkhairane in Navi Mumbai and abandoned it before running away, the police said. Mr Sanghvi\'s family went to the police and filed a missing report after he did not return home till late on Wednesday night.</p>\r\n<p>A day later, the executive\'s car was found abandoned near a high-rise apartment building in Navi Mumbai, with bloodstains and a knife on the rear seat. Two days after that his father received a call, with the caller telling him that his son was safe and he need not worry. The police said that the call was made from Mr Sanghvi\'s phone from Navi Mumbai, although the SIM card was different. The police found that the phone was with Sarfaraz. Mr Sanghvi lived in south Mumbai\'s affluent Malabar Hill area with his wife and eight-year-old son. A specialist in credit and market risk, he joined the bank in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>His disappearance unnerved banking and corporate circles and fanned several theories, including one of murder by jealous colleagues and suspected professional rivalry. On Monday, the police raised doubts about the theory but said that all angles will be investigated. Shaikh has been charged with Mr Sanghvi\'s murder. He was produced before a Mumbai Court and sent to police custody till September 19.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

Dr Pannian, a statement from the teachers said, \'was protesting this precise act of criminalisation by the university and the police of this action of the student in the course of a democratic protest\'. \"<em>This attempt to criminalise protest and dissent as a whole by the university administration deserves widespread criticism,</em>\" the statement said. \"Dr Pannian is an important scholar who in the context of his work on Edward Said brought out the role of dissent and democracy in shaping contemporary third world societies.</p>\r\n<p>It is most unfortunate and condemnable that his university administration instead of nurturing his sensibilities came down heavily on his defence of dissent and freedom to protest democratically,\" the statement from Federation president Rajib Ray said.

In a powerful Instagram post shared about 10 hours ago, Masaba criticised the cartoon for its \"<em>exaggeration of black women in shape, form &amp; mannerism</em>.\" The cartoon, published two days after Serena\'s heated exchanges with umpire Carlos Ramos during the US Open final on Saturday, depicts Serena in exaggerated physical proportions, throwing a temper tantrum. Her opponent, mixed race Naomi Osaka, is depicted as a slim blonde. Serena\'s outburst - in which she called Mr Ramos a \'thief\' after being deducted a point - has sharply divided the Internet with leading tennis figures such as Billie Jean King calling out the umpiring on double standards and pointing out that male players get away with similar or worse behaviour, and others condemning Serena\'s meltdown as childish and entitled and defending the umpiring as fair and just.</p>\r\n<p>Masaba Gupta\'s post, however, is a critique not of what Serena Williams did on court but of how it has been portrayed in Mark Knight\'s controversial cartoon. The cartoon has been severely and widely criticised for being racist as it depicts a \"butch and fat-lipped\" Serena having a tantrum on court after she lost to Naomi Osaka. It has been accused into feeding stereotypes of the \'angry black woman\' while also demeaning of physical appearance. \"<em>This is exactly who we all are. Tough, unapologetic &amp; not afraid of being compared with men,\" wrote Masaba in her post, \"I stand for the racket busting, angry-young woman in the tutu who you are purely intimidated by.\"</em> In her takedown, Masaba criticised the cartoon not just for its racial overtones but also for its insinuation that women must be \"elegant\" and \"delicate\" while showing their displeasure. \"<em>Did someone tell you that aggression was reserved only for men?</em>\" she asked. Since being shared online, her post has collected over 8,000 \'likes\' and dozens of supportive comments. \"<em>Thank you! It physically hurt the way people went after her that day. I knew it would give them fuel and a focus for hate because they\'re intimidated,</em>\" writes one commenter. \"<em>Couldn\'t agree more,</em>\" says another.</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1);
