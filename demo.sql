Among the many chic celeb appearances at the New York Fashion Week 2018, Priyanka is among those to be scoring high on the style charts. She was recently spotted at the Longchamp fashion show on September 8, where she made a chic appearance in a long-sleeved, printed maxi dress from the label.

Ditto for Pujara, who got a sharp incutter that breached his defence. He wanted a DRS but was late in appealing for one.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 16.5pt; background: white; margin: 7.5pt 0cm 3.75pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; color: #161616;\">Skipper Virat Kohli after a tremendous English summer where he scored 593 runs finally got out for a duck as he nicked one off Broad to Jonny Bairstow, leaving India in tatters. KL Rahul (46 batting) batted in cavalier fashion hitting eight boundaries in the company of Ajinkya Rahane (10 batting).</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 16.5pt; background: white; margin: 7.5pt 0cm 3.75pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; color: #161616;\">However, the day certainly belonged to Cook, who scored his 33rd hundred his last appearance to join a select band of players having scored a hundred on debut and final Test.

The most convenient option seems to be grabbing a quick or sandwich along with a cup of coffee, or even worse, skipping breakfast. There is a reason why breakfast is hailed as the most important meal of the day. It is the first meal of the day which gives a kickstart to your energy levels. On days when you skip breakfast, your metabolism messes up. Skipping up breakfast slows down body\'s fat burning process. Also, on days when you skip breakfast, you are more likely to make poor food habits throughout the day. Eating a healthy breakfast during the day helps in reducing cravings and prevents excessive hunger in later part of the day.&nbsp;<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-05/breakfast_650x400_61525935969.jpg\" alt=\"breakfast\" /></div>\r\n</div>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

He also said the size of frauds in the public sector banking system had been increasing, though was still small compared to the overall volume of NPAs or Non-Performing Assets.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />\"The RBI set up a fraud monitoring cell when I was Governor to coordinate the early reporting of fraud cases to the investigative agencies. I also sent a list of high profile cases to the PMO urging that we coordinate action to bring in at least one or two to book. I am not aware of progress on this front. This is a matter that should be addressed with urgency,\" said Mr Rajan in his report.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />Unfortunately, he said, the system had been \"singularly ineffective\" in bringing even a single high profile fraudster to book. \"As a result, fraud is not discouraged,\" Mr Rajan said.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />The Congress seized on the point and alleged that the former Reserve Bank of India governor had indicted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his office. \"Why didn\'t the PM take action against these known defaulters? When we demitted office the NPA was 2.83 lakh crore. How much is bad loans today- it\'s&nbsp;<span class=\"rupee\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">R<span style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">s.</span></span></span>&nbsp;12 lakh crore,\" said Congress leader Randeep Surjewala.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />Raghuram Rajan\'s report also suggests, as prevention: \"Improve governance of public sector banks and distance them from the government\".<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />A larger number of bad loans originated in the period 2006-2008, said Mr Rajan, when economic growth was strong and previous infrastructure projects such as power plants had been completed on time and within budget.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />\"It is at such times that banks make mistakes. They extrapolate past growth and performance to the future. So, they are willing to accept higher leverage in projects, and less promoter equity. Indeed, sometimes banks signed up to lend based on project reports by the promoter\'s investment bank, without doing their own due diligence,\" he said.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />This is the historic phenomenon of irrational exuberance, common across countries at such a phase in the cycle, said Mr Rajan, who was RBI governor for three years till September 2016.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />His report also said: \"A variety of governance problems such as the suspect allocation of coal mines coupled with the fear of investigation slowed down government decision-making in Delhi, both in the UPA and the subsequent NDA governments\".<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />Project cost overruns escalated for stalled projects and they became increasingly unable to service debt, he said. \"The continuing travails of the stranded power plants, even though India is short of power, suggests government decision-making has not picked up sufficient pace to date,\" he says.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />Over malfeasance and corruption in the NPA problem, he said, \"Undoubtedly, there was some, but it is hard to tell banker exuberance, incompetence, and corruption apart\".<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />\"Clearly, bankers were overconfident and probably did too little due diligence for some of these loans. Many did no independent analysis, and placed excessive reliance on SBI Caps and IDBI to do the necessary due diligence,\" the note said.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />He also tackled criticism of his policy to identify NPAs, saying the claim was \"ludicrous\" and made by people who have not done their homework.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />Stating that \"hindsight is 20/20\", Mr Rajan said the RBI \"should probably have raised more flags about the quality of lending in the early days of banking exuberance.\"<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />He added: \"The RBI could have been more decisive in enforcing penalties on non-compliant banks.

Petrol prices in the last few months have sky-rocketed and are now ready to score a century. Petroleum prices always have a cascading effect on the economy but for reasons unknown, the Congress president was not enthused till today to give this issue some serious attention.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The 2019 elections are eight months away and in all likelihood, Modi will try to project it as a two-horse race between himself and Rahul as the challenger. There is an understanding in the saffron camp that this fight suits Modi and the Hindutva Brigade. It is argued within the RSS fold that Rahul isn\'t enough of a suitable boy to combat the charisma, energy, confidence, strategy and acumen and cunningness that Modi brings. And so Modi, despite a poor report card, will shine in comparison and people will be left with no option but to vote for him. Sceptics also believe that a burst of Rahul Gandhi on TV screens is part of the scheme to ensure that no other strong leader from the opposition camp who is capable of overshadowing Modi gets a shot at the spotlight - so Modi\'s&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">champu</em>-media is deliberately giving him air space and trying to project Rahul as the prime ministerial candidate of a joint opposition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2018-09/ck4oors_rahul-gandhi_625x300_10_September_18.jpg\" alt=\"ck4oors\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Congress president Rahul Gandhi launched a sharp attack on PM Modi as over 20 opposition parties supported an all-India strike over rising fuel prices</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">There is no doubt that Rahul since the Gujarat elections has been trying to change his image and narrative including with his temple-hopping. Visiting Mansarovar is an endeavour to get rid of the tag that Congress is a Muslim party and the Nehru-Gandhi family indulges in Muslim appeasement. But as of now, his attempt looks feeble. Nor does his name inspire the confidence that he can replace Modi as a competent, decisive and powerful leader. There is anger for sure against Modi and people are looking for an alternative. But Modi can be confident of the \'TINA\'&nbsp;factor - There Is No Alternative - working in his favour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-12/rahul-gandhi-temple-twitter-650_650x400_71513749363.jpg\" alt=\"rahul gandhi temple twitter 650\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Rahul Gandhi at Chamunda Mataji Temple in Chotila, Gujarat</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">And for this, Rahul himself is to be blamed. Politics is about the right chemistry and arithmetic. Modi\'s unprecedented success lies in his unmatched talent to connect with the people. He speaks with them in a language that resonates but the same can\'t be said about Rahul. He is not a natural with crowds. He also does not feel comfortable in the company of senior leaders of opposition; in fact, even within his own team, he is decidedly not at ease with seniors who worked closely with his mother. But a bigger failing than his chemistry is his math. The Congress has to stitch alliances with regional parties. The index of opposition unity will play a very important role if a robust fight is planned to unseat Modi and dislodge the BJP. But as of now, strategic coherence is lacking. Different leaders are talking in different tones. The opposition seems to have failed in presenting an alternative narrative and structure to Modi.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-12/narendra-modi-rahul-gandhi-pti-650_650x400_71512980387.jpg\" alt=\"narendra modi rahul gandhi pti 650\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Congress president Rahul Gandhi (File photo)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">In 1989 and 1996, the opposition moved faster. It had many stalwarts. If in 1989, Devi Lal, L K Advani, Jyoti Basu and NTR played a pivotal role, then in 1996, Harkishan Singh Surjeet andChandrababu Naidu were the moving force. Similarly, Surjeet was equally influential in 2004\'s post-poll alliances. Now, Rahul has to take up that role. He is the leader of the biggest party and it is his responsibility to talk to everybody, keep them in loop about every development and future planning. But that is not the case. Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee are active but don\'t seem to be coordinating with Rahul, whose own team looks clueless as it tweets photos from foreign countries rather than focusing on relationship-building at home.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/hd-kumaraswamy-swearing-in-opposition-leaders_625x300_1527126230218.jpg\" alt=\"hd kumaraswamy swearing in opposition leaders\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Panoramic photo-op of all opposition leaders at HD Kumaraswamy\'s oath as Karnataka Chief Minister</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Uttar Pradesh is extremely crucial. The by-elections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana have proved beyond doubt that if Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul decide to fight together, Modi will be stopped. There are media reports that Mayawati and Akhilesh are talking to each other and they might forge an alliance but nothing concrete has happened yet. By now, Rahul should have been instrumental in bringing them together on a common and killing any rumour that Mayawati is drifting towards BJP due to the pressure of investigating agencies. In Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, elections can be announced any minute. Data shows that in 2003, 2008, 2013 assembly elections, the combined vote percentage of the Congress and BSP beats that of the BJP. So if these two parties come together, the BJP could be defeated. Mayawati seems eager but the same urgency is not seen at Rahul\'s front. If he has to make compromises in terms of seat-sharing, then he should do so for the larger goal.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/mayawati_sonia-gandhi_pti-_625x300_1527315759912.jpg\" alt=\"mayawati\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">The show-stealing hug between BSP chief Mayawati and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Similarly, whether Rahul likes it or not, AAP is the dominant party in Delhi. It has occupied the space which once was unquestionably the Congress\'s. If AAP and Congress decide to come together in the national capital, they can win all seven Lok Sabha seats. The alliance could be equally productive in Punjab where AAP is the main opposition party. Despite the factionalism in AAP in Punjab, the Congress should ignore it at its own peril. Punjab and Delhi together have 20 seats. At a time when every seat counts, 20 seats can prove to be huge in making or breaking a government in 2019. But Rahul seems to be governed by the whims of local leaders who have ulterior motives in keeping AAP away from Congress. In Maharashtra, Shiv Sena has been the biggest critic of Modi since he became Prime Minister. The Sena should have been lured into breaking away by now to join the combined opposition. But the Congress is worried that this might annoy Muslims voters. Rahul has forgotten that to defeat his father, Rajiv Gandhi, the CPM-CPI and BJP decided to take the same path. V P Singh\'s government was supported by both the BJP and the Left. Why can\'t Rahul find a way to rope in the Shiv Sena?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/199k7fs8_uddhav-thackeray-narendra-modi-file_625x300_13_August_18.jpg\" alt=\"199k7fs8\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">NDA ally Shiv Sena has been opposing the BJP and its policies (File photo)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Rahul should not forget that no other member of the Nehru-Gandhi family has gone through such a deep crisis.

The grand old party, Farooq Abdullah\'s National Conference, was the first to say it would boycott local bodies and panchayat elections. Then Mehbooba Mufti\'s PDP, the other big regional player, followed suit. Various smaller parties have already said no to the elections, scheduled for October-December.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />The parties say they cannot support the election process at a time when the centre is not supporting Article 35A - the cornerstone of Kashmir\'s special constitutional status in the Indian Union. The Article, passed through a Presidential order in 1954, has been challenged in the Supreme Court, which has deferred hearing the matter to January upon the centre\'s request. The centre said the hearing and verdict could impact the holding of panchayat and municipal elections. The regional parties hit back, saying, \"We will not participate before the issue is resolved and safeguarding of Article 35A is assured\'\'.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-11/farooq_650x400_61510092233.jpg\" alt=\"farooq\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Farooq Abdullah had said that the decision to hold local body polls elections was hurried</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Getting people to vote has been both a challenge and advantage for India in Kashmir. Separatist groups demand a vote for plebiscite. They say India\'s commitment to the UN and the people of Kashmir on holding a referendum makes this obligatory. Till then, they want a boycott of all elections which they believe strengthens Indian democracy in the state. Militants enforce this boycott by targeting anyone who stands against this idea. Unionist parties have been fighting this idea by supporting the cause of elections. Today, both sides have found a common cause, which has led to a sense of vindication for separatists. The controversy surrounding Article 35A has blurred the lines.

Following the Indira-Abdullah accord, Sheikh returned to the mainstream in 1975 which led to the first participative, free and fair election in the state in 1977.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/oa42hbek_article-35a-protests-kashmir-afp-_625x300_31_August_18.jpg\" alt=\"oa42hbek\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Article 35A, that bars outsiders from owning property in Jammu and Kashmir, has been challenged in the Supreme Court</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">After the emergence of militancy, the NC became the main target in the attempt to wipe out pro-India politics in Kashmir. Hundreds of party workers were killed by militants for its stand supporting the Indian democratic system. After living in exile, Farooq Abdullah returned to contest elections in 1996 following assurances of the restoration of the state\'s autonomy. From Burkina Faso, then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao promised, \"The sky is the limit\" for Kashmir\'s autonomy, \"short of&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">Azadi</em>.\" Subsequently, the United Front Government included greater autonomy to J&amp;K in its common minimum programme.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />But when Farooq Abdullah came up with a resolution on autonomy that was passed by the J&amp;K assembly in 2000, the central government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee summarily rejected it, partly because of Abdullah\'s own non-seriousness. Instead of submitting a copy of the autonomy report and assembly resolution to the Prime Minister himself, he chose to hand it over to an intelligence officer in Srinagar for further perusal.</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/3neh2ivo_atal-bihari-vajpayee-mufti-sayeed-650_625x300_16_August_18.jpg\" alt=\"3neh2ivo\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee looked beyond politics to end Kashmir\'s problems</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The 2002 assembly elections saw the emergence of PDP which led to competitive politics laced with sub-nationalistic rhetoric. Vajpayee reached out to the people of Kashmir, giving much needed credence to mainstream politics. The gun lost its coercive power. The era of coercive voting and coercive boycotts was over. Mainstream politics became participative.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The mainstream politics took roots and withstood 2008 and 2010 civilian unrest. Boycott calls by separatists were rejected with massive participation in elections.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />It was during and after 2016 that things went horribly wrong. The centre\'s muscular policy coupled with the state government\'s arrogance and incompetence compounded the problem. The state resorted to collective punishment of people. Areas showing dissent were treated like enemy territories. Damaging electric transformers to cut power supply to villages, vandalising houses and orchards were some of the means employed to punish the rebellious population. Victims were blamed for their death, injuries and mass blinding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">\r\n<div class=\"ins_instory_dv_cont\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; width: 630px;\"><img id=\"story_image_main\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/narendra-modi-mehbooba-mufti-reuters_625x300_1526752533376.jpg\" alt=\"narendra modi mehbooba mufti reuters\" /></div>\r\n<p class=\"ins_instory_dv_caption\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 5px; background-color: #f2f2f2; border-bottom: 1px solid #f2f2f2; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: #666666 !important;\">PDP president Mehbooba Mufti urged PM Modi to follow Atal Bihari Vajpayee\'s vision of Jammu and Kashmir (File photo)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">People exacted revenge through voting.

The Anantnag by-election had to be cancelled a day before the voting.&nbsp;<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />Since then, the debate has surged over whether elections can be held in Kashmir in the near future. Mind you, it is not militancy that\'s posing a challenge, nor is the problem something that can be dealt with by using more force. The challenge is coming from the people. They are angry, hurt and frustrated. With Governor\'s Rule in place, the announcement to hold municipal and panchayat elections without any consultation with political parties was bound to boomerang.&nbsp;<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\" />The time to initiate talks and find a solution is now.

This reputation of street foods has been built upon the assumption that most of the food carts on the streets have questionable hygiene standards, use unhealthy ingredients to prepare these dishes, and serve them in unclean utensils. But, all that is about to change as the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has started a massive initiative to raise the quality of street food vending to the level of food courts and established hotels and restaurants. The government organisation has even declared a popular street food area in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, as India\'s first \'Clean Street Food Hub\'. An FSSAI press release on the announcement said that Kankaria Lake, with about 66 street food vendors, has won the tag of India\'s first \'Clean Street Food Hub.\'</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: white; box-sizing: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 11.25pt 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto; color: #333333;\">With cuisines like&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto;\">pao bhaji</span></em>, Chinese,&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto;\">bhel puri</span></em>, ice cream,&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto;\">khichu</span></em>, popcorn,&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto;\">dhokla, masala dosa, pani puri</span></em>&nbsp;etc., and the release said that the area caters to about 1.2 crore street food enthusiasts every year. FSSAI has even installed a plaque at the location, which means that Gujarati foodies in the state\'s capital can now happily flock to any of the numerous stalls in Kankaria Lake and partake in the delicious food, without any worries of tummy troubles or diseases. Concerned authorities have declared that \"the street of Kankaria Lake, Ahmedabad meets 80% of the specified benchmarks of basic hygiene and sanitary requirements, and hence, can be awarded as \'Clean Street Food Hub\',\" says the press release.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: white; box-sizing: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto; color: #333333;\">This declaration was only made after the area was first identified as a popular food street and a pre-audit of the stalls here was conducted by FSSAI along with FDCA, Gujarat and DNVGL Business Assurance India Pvt. Ltd. The officials gave suggestions to fill in gaps in the hygiene standards of the vendors here and consequently Food Safety Awareness and Training Organisation (FSATO) was delegated the work of training the street food vendors, with special attention to areas improvement was required. As a part of the initiative, FSSAI has also framed guidelines to improve the existing infrastructure of famous street food areas and clusters in cities and towns across India, in order to provide tourists and foodies with a safe and hygienic local eating experience.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',serif; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto; color: #333333;\">The release on the announcement quoted Pawan Kumar, the CEO of FSSAI as saying, \"We all Indians are fond of street food, and yet not very comfortable taking it for reason of poor hygiene and quality.\" He added by saying that the Clean Street Food Hub initiative was aimed at radically improving street food vending in the country to make Indian street food, \"popular and \'must have\' for both domestic and international tourists while also preserving rich culinary heritage of the country.\" Next on FSSAI\'s list of are four more Gujarat cities - Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Dahod - which will be converted to Clean Street Food Hubs in the coming months.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', '0', 0, 'published', 1),

In a powerful Instagram post shared about 10 hours ago, Masaba criticised the cartoon for its \"exaggeration of black women in shape, form &amp; mannerism.\" The cartoon, published two days after Serena\'s heated exchanges with umpire Carlos Ramos during the US Open final on Saturday, depicts Serena in exaggerated physical proportions, throwing a temper tantrum. Her opponent, mixed race Naomi Osaka, is depicted as a slim blonde.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px;\">Serena\'s outburst - in which she called Mr Ramos a \'thief\' after being deducted a point - has sharply divided the Internet with leading tennis figures such as Billie Jean King&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: inherit; text-decoration-line: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #326891 !important;\" href=\"https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/carlos-ramos-backed-by-international-tennis-federation-over-regrettable-serena-williams-rant-1914500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calling out the umpiring&nbsp;</a>on double standards and pointing out that male players get away with similar or worse behaviour, and others condemning Serena\'s meltdown as childish and entitled and defending the umpiring as fair and just.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;\">Masaba Gupta\'s post, however, is a critique not of what Serena Williams did on court but of how it has been portrayed in Mark Knight\'s controversial cartoon. The cartoon has been severely and widely criticised for being racist as it depicts a \"<a style=\"box-sizing: inherit; text-decoration-line: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #326891 !important;\" href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-open-2018-for-racist-sketch-of-serena-williams-mark-knight-australian-cartoonist-under-fire-1914549\">butch and fat-lipped</a>\" Serena having a tantrum on court after she lost to Naomi Osaka. It has been accused into feeding stereotypes of the \'angry black woman\' while also demeaning of physical appearance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;\">\"This is exactly who we all are. Tough, unapologetic &amp; not afraid of being compared with men,\" wrote Masaba in her post, \"I stand for the racket busting, angry-young woman in the tutu who you are purely intimidated by.\"&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;\">In her takedown, Masaba criticised the cartoon not just for its racial overtones but also for its insinuation that women must be \"elegant\" and \"delicate\" while showing their displeasure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;\">\"Did someone tell you that aggression was reserved only for men?\" she asked.</p>\r\n<div id=\"checked\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;\">Since being shared online, her post has collected over 8,000 \'likes\' and dozens of supportive comments. \"Thank you!
